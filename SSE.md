- uses HTTP
	- HTTP version notes:
		- (Wikipedia) As SSE relies on persistent connections and [chunked transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding "Chunked transfer encoding"), it needs at least HTTP/1.1. In HTTP/2 the multiplexing on a shared TCP connection can lead to [head-of-line blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking "Head-of-line blocking").
		- (MDN) **Warning:** When **not used over HTTP/2**, SSE suffers from a limitation to the maximum number of open connections, which can be especially painful when opening multiple tabs, as the limit is _per browser_ and is set to a very low number (6). The issue has been marked as "Won't fix" in [Chrome](https://crbug.com/275955) and [Firefox](https://bugzil.la/906896). This limit is per browser + domain, which means that you can open 6 SSE connections across all of the tabs to `www.example1.com` and another 6 SSE connections to `www.example2.com` (per [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5195452/websockets-vs-server-sent-events-eventsource/5326159)). When using HTTP/2, the maximum number of simultaneous _HTTP streams_ is negotiated between the server and the client (defaults to 100).
